    <h3>NetApp HCI Benchmark tool NBench</h3>
    <p>
      Real production environments are almost never about a single workload or applicaiton, so why
      would you benchmark only one workload?
    </p>
    <p>
      Other benchmarking tools focuse on just one type of workload, so we created our own
      allowing you to create a benchmark that consists of a mix of workloads that reflect
      your production environment.
